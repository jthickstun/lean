This lemma is fundamental.

Uniqueness is subtle as always. Most proofs of this I saw come in one of two flavors:
  (i) Assume two different (distinct) pairs and derive a contradiction
  (ii) Show that -1 < difference < 1 and conclude that there is no difference
       (because the numbers in question must be integers)
I chose the second approach here, but I wanted to avoid talking about integers (this
would require pulling in the whole ℤ library and setting up some possibly messy
correspondences between ℕ and ℤ). So instead, I modified approach (ii) to use
distances instead of differences; the whole argument goes through and we completely
avoid talking about negative numbers. The tradeoff is that we need to develop some
theory about the distance function (see .distance).

This is actually the opposite direction of the lemma attributed to Euclid.
The other direction (irreducible p → prime p) seems much harder; it typically
runs through Bezout's identity, which requires some claims about integers,
greatest common divisors, and the Euclidean algorithm.

Euclid's lemma p → irreducible p is used as a lemma to prove the fundamental
theorem of arithmetic in the traditional development. However, there appears to
be a very slick direct proof of FTA by induction. Euclid's classic result would 
then become a corollary of FTA and this might be the most efficient way to develop
basic number theory.

I wrote this proof before I figured out how to use tactics; can it be made more
elegant? Most of the book-keeping seems to come from chasing down quantifiers and
propositonal connectives, so it's not clear whether tactics can help all that much.
