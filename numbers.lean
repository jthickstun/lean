Uniqueness is subtle as always. Most proofs of this I saw come in one of two flavors:
  (i) Assume two different (distinct) pairs and derive a contradiction
  (ii) Show that -1 < difference < 1 and conclude that there is no difference
       (because the numbers in question must be integers)
I chose the second approach here, but I wanted to avoid talking about integers (this
would require pulling in the whole ℤ library and setting up some possibly messy
correspondences between ℕ and ℤ). So instead, I modified approach (ii) to use
distances instead of differences; the whole argument goes through and we completely
avoid talking about negative numbers. The tradeoff is that we need to develop some
theory about the distance function (see .distance).

Euclid's lemma irreducible p → prime p is used as a lemma to prove the 
fundamental theorem of arithmetic in the traditional development. The
other direction also holds.

I wrote the proof of the converse before I figured out how to use tactics;
can it be made more elegant? Most of the book-keeping seems to come from
chasing down quantifiers and propositonal connectives, so it's not clear
whether tactics can help all that much, although at least it would kill
off a lots of irritating stupid parentheses.
